# Prompt:
Mostly customers or visitors would like to know the time it'll take for their order to be delivered.
- Let's get the location of the visitor first when the app loads. Use a modal UI for desktop or a shadcn sheet (with side="bottom") for mobile
- Hard code the various locations we deliver to, together with the time it'll takes to deliver the order. Remember to use Ghana, Kumasi context for the locations. Provide clear comment in the code on adding more locations later
- In the modal or sheet, the visitor can search and choose their prefered location
- Ones thier location is saved, the estimated time for complete delivery will show on each product card or details (page) UI
- If the user does not choose their location, do not show anything but provide an alert at the top with clear, simple words for them to add or choose their location
- Take inspiration from the UI I've uploaded and make sure the customer can change thier location anytime they want. Use clear and intuitive interface here
- Utilize local storage and make sure the flow of choosing or changing a location is smooth and simple
