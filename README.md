## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/myspace8s-projects/v0-e-commerce-website](https://vercel.com/myspace8s-projects/v0-e-commerce-website)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

# Prompt:
Mostly customers or visitors would like to know the time it'll take for their order to be delivered.
- Let's get the location of the visitor first when the app loads. Use a modal UI for desktop or a shadcn sheet (with side="bottom") for mobile
- Hard code the various locations we deliver to, together with the time it'll takes to deliver the order. Remember to use Ghana, Kumasi context for the locations. Provide clear comment in the code on adding more locations later
- In the modal or sheet, the visitor can search and choose their prefered location
- Ones thier location is saved, the estimated time for complete delivery will show on each product card or details (page) UI
- If the user does not choose their location, do not show anything but provide an alert at the top with clear, simple words for them to add or choose their location
- Take inspiration from the UI I've uploaded and make sure the customer can change thier location anytime they want. Use clear and intuitive interface here
- Utilize local storage and make sure the flow of choosing or changing a location is smooth and simple

# New New
- I believe customers should be able to add reviews to each product they try. So in the home page, we can have a section containing particular products, where we ask the customer to provide review for those products. These products will be driven by a simple algorithm which is based on succesful order and delivery.
**Order Timeline/Progress Tracker** - Add a visual timeline showing the order journey (Pending → Confirmed → Preparing → Ready → Completed) with timestamps for each stage
**Reorder Button** - Add a quick "Reorder" button on completed orders to let customers easily reorder the same items
**Order Tracking Map** - For delivery orders, show a simple map with the delivery location and estimated arrival time
**Customer Support Chat** - Add a direct WhatsApp chat button on each order for quick support/inquiries
**Order Filters & Search** - Add filters to view orders by status (pending, completed, etc.) and search by order number or date
**Estimated Delivery/Pickup Time Countdown** - Show a countdown timer for upcoming pickups/deliveries
**Order Rating & Feedback** - After order completion, allow customers to rate and leave feedback
**Order Receipt/Invoice** - Add a downloadable PDF receipt for each order
**Notification Badges** - Show unread status updates with notification badges
**Empty State Enhancements** - Add illustrations and motivational messaging to encourage browsing the menu

### Why Time Slots in Scheduling?

slots are like reserved parking spots for your order, making everything smoother for you *and* the team. Here's the quick rationale behind them in the app:

- **Prevents Chaos (Ops Side)**: Without slots, everyone might pick the same time (e.g., lunch rush at 1 PM), overwhelming the kitchen. Slots cap orders per half-hour (e.g., max 5 pickups, 3 deliveries), so preps stay on track—especially for melt-prone ice cream or fresh pastries.

- **Better for You (User Side)**: You get real-time visibility ("3 spots left at 2:00 PM ⚠️") to snag your preferred time without surprises. No more "Sorry, we're swamped—wait 2 hours?"

- **Fits the Biz (Kumasi Context)**: Short slots (30 mins) match quick-turn sweets, with business hours (9AM-9PM weekdays) to avoid late-night rushes. It prompts always (no auto-ASAP) so you control when your boba's ready, but validation ensures it's feasible.

It's mock for now (localStorage tracks "bookings"), but scales to real backend for live updates. Slots = happy customers + happy staff. Want to tweak intervals or add "ASAP" as default?
